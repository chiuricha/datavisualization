                <img src="3.jpg" alt="Points Scored by Age Image" class="article-image">
                <p>Michael Jordan started his NBA career at age 21.
                    Following his 1st year in NBA, he suffered an injury
                    at age 22, and ended up missing 64 of 82 NBA
                    games. Jordan had 2 retirements, each at age 30
                    and age 35-37. Despite the season with injuries,
                    and 2 time retirements, we can see Jordan
                    outscores other players throughout his career.</p>
                <p>Kobe entered the NBA at an extremely young age
                    (18). Known for his scoring abilities, its surprising
                    seeing Kobe’s graph would look like this
                    comparing to other 2. However it is also clear that
                    at the age of 27, his scoring abilities at prime time
                    is comparable to Michael Jordan.</p>
                <p>Lebron James’ graph showed us his longevity and
                    consistence throughout his career. It is clear to
                    see Lebron has taken his health and wellness
                    seriously, so he is able to maintain his consistence
                    from the age of 19 to age 39. And his legacy still
                    goes on until this day.</p>

                <h1>Career Averages</h1>
                <img src="1.avif" alt="Career Averages Image" class="article-image">
                <p>Michael Jordan has the highest scoring averages
                    among the 3 players, while maintaining a high
                    49.7% field goals on average. His defending
                    averages on steals and blocks also ranks 1st
                    among other players.
                </p>
                <p>Despite known for his scoring abilities, Kobe
                    surprisingly falls short on his score averages and
                    field goals percentage. His rebounding, stealing,
                    and blocking falls short too comparing to the
                    other 2 players.</p>
                <p>Lebron is known for his all around game abilities
                    on both end of the court. This is shown on the
                    statistics too, scoring an average of 27.1 points
                    while maintaining an extremely high percentage
                    of field goals (50.6%). Note he is also the best
                    rebounder out of the 3, but quite a
                    disappointment on the defensive side with his
                    atheleticism.</p>

                <h1>Player Abilities</h1>
                <img src="2.webp" alt="Player Abilities Image" class="article-image">
                <p>Michael Jordan is the best scorer according to the
                    graph. Out of 100, he has 94 on outside scoring
                    and 85 on inside scoring (near basket). His
                    defending abilities also ranks 1st among the 3
                    players.</p>
                <p>Kobe’s statistics again shows his abilities are not
                    comparable to the other 2 players. When
                    combining the 3 radar graphs together, the
                    differences are clearly seen that, Kobe falls short
                    on most of the categories other than outside
                    scoring, which is his well known ability.</p>
                <p>Lebron James on this graph once again shows us
                    his all around abilities due to his height and
                    athleticism. When combining lebron’s grpah and
                    Jordan’s graph together, Lebron outscores Jordan
                    on Inside scoring, rebounding, playmaking, and a
                    slight edge over Jordan’s atheleticism.</p>
